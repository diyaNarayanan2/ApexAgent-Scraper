Introducing the BETA Release of Our MMM Agent - Powered by PyMC-Marketing

July 11, 2025

By PyMC Labs

We're thrilled to open up BETA access to the latest version of our Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Agent - a fully AI-driven assistant built on top of PyMC-Marketing that turns what used to be a multi-month modeling effort into an interactive, informative, and insightful workflow in hours.

Whether you're a data scientist, media analyst, or CMO, this new BETA version is designed to get you to ROI-driven decisions faster - and with more confidence.

✅ What’s New (and Fast)#

Our MMM Agent is more than just another tool - it’s your AI co-pilot. Here’s what it can do:

Automated Data Wrangling
Stop wasting time on reconciling TikTok vs. GA4 inconsistencies. Upload your data and let the agent take care of the prep.

Smart Bayesian Modeling
Automatically selects appropriate techniques for carryover, saturation, and trend detection, tailored to your data.

Instant “What-If” Scenarios
Want to double your Facebook budget? Cut TV spend in half? Simulate it instantly and see the impact on ROI.

Causal Insights > Correlations
This isn’t another black-box MMM. Our agent incorporates experiments, interventions, and external data to give causally robust recommendations.

📈 What’s New Since Alpha#

We’ve made major improvements since the Alpha release, based on your feedback:

Inline code and charts within the chat interface
Persistent visualizations and tables stored in MLflow
Improved modeling diagnostics and debugging tools
🔮 What’s Coming Next#

The BETA is just the beginning. We're working on:

🧾 One-click summary deck generation
💸 An agent to optimize budgets given a fitted MMM
🧪 Custom model priors and functions (e.g., adstock curves, saturation functions)
🧠 Ability to define causal DAGs for deeper, structured modeling
🧪 Join the BETA Today#

We're looking for forward-thinking marketing teams, analytics leads, and data scientists to try out our MMM Agent and shape its next phase.

If you've ever been frustrated by slow MMM cycles, black-box models, or unclear ROI attribution — this is your chance to try something better.

👉 Apply for BETA access and get early insights into what’s working in your marketing mix.
