The Challenge: When Expertise Matters Most#

Imagine your team has to build a comprehensive in-house marketing measurement framework. It needs to be ready, robust, and credible in time for your company's Annual Business Planning cycle. The deadline is not negotiable, and the quality of the framework will shape budget decisions for the year ahead.

Or picture another scenario: your team must pass an internal review set by your parent company. Only if you can demonstrate that your models are rigorous and production-ready will you be allowed to own analytics in-house, rather than having measurement dictated by third-party consultancies.

These are not hypotheticals. They are real situations our clients have faced.

Many organizations recognize the value of advanced models, but they struggle to get the right expertise at the right time. Hiring consultants for one-off projects delivers short-term gains, but when the project ends, so does the support. Expanding the team with new employees can be just as difficult and expensive, especially when you already have a capable data science group in place. What these teams need is not more headcount or one-off advice, but a way to access expert guidance exactly when challenges arise.

Introducing the Expert Access Program#

Since our founding in 2020, PyMC Labs has focused on two core pillars. The first is building best-in-class bespoke models for global clients, delivering insights that drive meaningful business outcomes. One of the most notable examples of this work is our partnership with HelloFresh. The second pillar has always been knowledge transfer. From the beginning, we believed that the models we deliver should not sit idle, but actively support clients in making informed business decisions. That is why we pair bespoke model builds with workshops designed to upskill client teams, giving them the confidence and expertise to fully leverage the tools in front of them.

But as our client base grew, something new became clear. While projects and workshops gave teams a strong foundation, they increasingly asked for more: ongoing access to our expertise. They wanted guidance not just at the outset of a project, but as their teams engaged daily with our open source frameworks, experimented with new approaches, and encountered fresh challenges.

In response, we created the Expert Access Program (EAP). It provides a structured way for clients to stay connected with our experts, receive timely guidance, and make sure their investment in advanced models continues to deliver value long after the initial build. With EAP, teams accelerate their progress, avoid common pitfalls, and stay at the cutting edge of modern analytics practices.

Why PyMC Labs: From Open Source to Industry Partner#

Our story begins in open source software, but today we sit at the table with CMOs and strategy leaders. PyMC Labs emerged from the core team behind PyMC, one of the world's most widely-used probabilistic modeling frameworks, trusted by thousands of organizations globally. As PyMC matured and attracted a vibrant community of researchers and developers, it established itself as the foundation for modern probabilistic programming in Python.

PyMC Labs was created to take this open source innovation and make it directly useful for industry. Since then, our work has expanded into specialized tools like PyMC-Marketing, which brings proven approaches for media mix modeling, customer lifetime value, and experimentation into production-ready libraries. Alongside it, we built CausalPy, a toolkit for causal inference and uplift modeling. These frameworks have quickly become the backbone for many data science teams, with PyMC-Marketing now used by thousands of practitioners and trusted by enterprise teams as part of their analytics infrastructure.

In this way, PyMC Labs has grown from an open source project into a partner for companies seeking to turn cutting-edge statistical research into practical, decision-driving tools.

How the Expert Access Program Works#

The Expert Access Program was created to meet the need for ongoing expertise access. Instead of leaving teams to figure things out alone, the program provides continuity through two structured tiers:

Base Package: Your Expert Lifeline#

The foundation of EAP ensures your team never gets stuck. When you hit a roadblock - whether it's interpreting model diagnostics, debugging sampling issues, or deciding between modeling approaches- you have direct access to our experts through a dedicated communication channel.

What's included:

Direct expert communication channel with priority response within one business day
Access to our growing library of implementation guides and best practices
Pro Package: Deep Partnership and Strategic Guidance#

For organizations with higher stakes - those facing critical deadlines, internal reviews, or complex implementation challenges - the Pro package adds structured, proactive support.

Everything in Base Package, plus:

Bi-weekly coaching calls with dedicated experts matching to your domain and challenges
Bi-monthly Expert Exchange Sessions featuring case studies, emerging methods, and industry trends
Priority access to new PyMC Labs tools and early feature previews
Custom workshop development for your specific modeling challenges
Strategic consultation on measurement frameworks, analytics roadmaps and stakeholder gaining stakeholder buy-in

Both tiers give you what traditional consulting can't: continuity. Instead of starting from scratch each time you face a new challenge, you build on an ongoing relationship with experts who understand your context, your data, and your goals.

What Our Clients Say#

Hearing directly from clients shows the tangible impact of our work and how the Expert Access Program builds on trusted partnerships:

‚ÄúThe PyMC Labs Coaching program has been transformative for our small Data Science team, enabling us to deliver results at the level of a full-scale department. We‚Äôve been able to leverage the coaching sessions at every stage of our delivery cycle, from early research and experimentation to implementation, deployment, and long-term roadmapping. The PyMC Labs coaches brought both technical expertise and practical guidance, helping us refine our models, review results, and even troubleshoot complex code issues. Their support not only accelerated our projects but also gave our team the confidence and structure to take on more ambitious work than we thought possible.‚Äù

Eugene Kwok, Executive Director Research & Analytics, Fox Entertainment

"PyMC Labs has significantly enhanced our testing capabilities by leveraging the full power of Bayesian programming, maximizing the potential of the PyMC software. Their advisory role in delivering new feature requests and training our team has been invaluable, driving substantial improvements in our operations."

Nathan Kafi, Principal Data Scientist, Haleon

"PyMC Labs was instrumental in helping us implement time-varying coefficients to better capture seasonality in our marketing mix models. This significantly improved both the accuracy and interpretability of our models, while also revealing additional opportunities for enhancement. Working with the PyMC Labs team was an absolute pleasure; they were collaborative, insightful, and consistently supportive throughout the engagement."

Kate Hirth, Senior Data Scientist, Fabletics
Voices from the Team#

The EAP is not just a service, it is a collaboration. We asked some of the PyMC Labs experts who work most closely with clients what they enjoy about the program:

‚ÄúThe EAP program is fantastic for both parties. On the one hand, clients get clear and actionable mentorship on how to use statistical models for efficient decision-making. We provide resources, examples, and detailed advice. We empathize with them because we have previously solved similar problems. On the other hand, we learn more about our users (and colleagues) to steer the development of our open-source solutions. ‚Äù

Juan Orduz, Principal Data Scientist, PyMC Labs

"What I enjoy most about the EAP is how collaborative it feels. We are not just solving technical problems, we are helping clients move past obstacles and gain confidence in their modeling approach. It is rewarding to be part of the model building journey, supporting clients as they move from one-off builds to creating sustained, impactful models."

Tim McWilliams, Principal Data Scientist, PyMC Labs

"The EAP lends itself to top-notch work. Our deep expertise in Bayesian methods allows us to quickly clear out roadblocks that would ordinarily consume weeks. That frees up our clients' data scientists to focus on being experts in their own data and stakeholder interests. I have really enjoyed working on EAP because everyone gets to do what they do best."

Daniel Saunders, Principal Data Scientist, PyMC Labs

"What I value most about working with clients through the EAP is the opportunity to bridge advanced statistical thinking with real-world decision making. It is great to see how our expertise can transform uncertainty into clarity, helping teams not only find solutions but also strengthen their own capacity to think probabilistically. My favorite part is witnessing that shift-when teams begin to see Bayesian methods not as a hurdle, but as a powerful ally in their scientific and business challenges."

Carlos Trujillo, Principal Data Scientist at PyMC Labs

‚ÄúTo me, the most rewarding aspect of the EAP is the collaboration itself. We get to bring our deep expertise in Bayesian modeling and statistical workflows, while our clients possess rich domain knowledge and business expertise. This combination allows us to build models that are not only technically robust but also genuinely aligned with real-world needs.‚Äù

Teemu S√§ilynoja, Junior Researcher at PyMC Labs.

‚ÄúMy favorite part about the EAP process is being able to teach clients not just how to make the one model that they are asking about, but also the fundamentals of Bayesian modeling. I love when things click for a client and then they are able to diagnose and solve their own problems without needing our help. Then we can collaborate on the really interesting problems.‚Äù

Bill Engels, Principal Data Scientist at PyMC Labs

‚ÄúAt PyMC, I get the most (EAP) satisfaction from working with curious, collaborative clients who are not only focused on solving problems but also open to exploring new ideas and unconventional solutions.

Through our Expert Access Program, you gain direct access to specialists who guide you in investigating, experimenting, and applying cutting-edge approaches with confidence. What makes PyMC unique is our ability to draw on expertise from a wide range of disciplines: Statistics, Physics, Engineering, Economics, Marketing Analytics, Neuroscience, Computer Programming, AI Development, and Business Strategy. This cross-disciplinary perspective allows us to bring in proven solutions from other industries; while not always necessary it‚Äôs having that advantage that makes these projects enjoyably challenging.‚Äù

Kemble Fletcher, Director - Product Development
