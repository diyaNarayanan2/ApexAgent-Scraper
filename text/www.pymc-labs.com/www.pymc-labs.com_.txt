Iraklis Pappas

Global Head of AI

Colgate-Palmolive

"This was one of the main advantages of working with PyMC Labs.Those are people who have been building the tool that we're using for modeling and so my prior was that these people know how to actually put together a firm foundation of the model and it ended up being exactly the way I expected.So we got a very solid, very efficient, very quickly-running model so that we could easily go and expand it."

Tarmo Jüristo

CEO

SALK

"We wanted to be able to draw some big conclusions out of a big set of data.So, that's why we came to PyMC Labs for help.It was very successful collaboration.I've had many, many consultants working with in the past, and I think this is by far the most successful Collaboration that I've seen."

Titi Alailima, MSE

VP of Applied Data

Akili

"I have some solid basis, but I'd say like, I'm sort of like random data scientist, not an expert in Probabilistic AI statistics and so, there was so much that i could do by myself.I was able to set up an initial model and get some interesting results and get buy-in internally to go further and that's where additional expertise.It was very helpful to get the model to the finish line and to production."

Manu Martinet, Phd
