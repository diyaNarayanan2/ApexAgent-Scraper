Bayesian Item Response Modeling in PyMC

October 26, 2022

By Thomas Wiecki

Introduction#

In this panel discussion, we discuss IRT (Item Response Theory), GRM (Graded Response Model) and the advantages to using the Bayesian approach at Alva Labs.

Item response theory, also known as the latent response theory, refers to a family of mathematical models that attempt to explain the relationship between latent traits (unobservable characteristic or attribute) and their manifestations (i.e. observed outcomes, responses or performance). Graded response model (or Ordered Categorical Responses Model) is a family of mathematical models for grading responses.
