Solving Real-World Business Problems with Bayesian Modeling

October 31, 2022

By Thomas Wiecki

Introduction#

Among Bayesian early adopters, digital marketing is chief. While many industries are embracing Bayesian modeling as a tool to solve some of the most advanced data science problems, marketing is facing unique challenges for which this approach provides elegant solutions. Among these challenges are a decrease in quality data, driven by an increased demand for online privacy and the imminent "death of the cookie" which prohibits online tracking. In addition, as more companies are building internal data science teams, there is an increased demand for in-house solutions.

In this talk Thomas explains how Bayesian modeling addresses these issues by:

(i) Incorporating expert knowledge of the structure as well as about plausible parameter rangers.

(ii) Connecting multiple different data sets to increase circumstantial evidence of latent user features.

(iii) Principled quantification of uncertainty to increase robustness of model fits and interpretation of the results.

Inspired by real-world problems we encountered at PyMC Labs, we will look at Media Mix Models for marketing attribution and Customer Lifetime Value models and various hybrids between them.
