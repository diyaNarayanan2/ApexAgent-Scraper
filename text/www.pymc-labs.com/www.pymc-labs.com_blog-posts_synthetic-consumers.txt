Key Insights
Synthetic Consumers: The Promise, The Reality, and The Future

June 03, 2025

By Nina Rismal, Luca Fiaschi

Synthetic consumers â€“ AI-generated personas designed to simulate human consumer behavior â€“ are rapidly transforming market research by delivering faster, cost-effective, and highly scalable insights compared to traditional methods. By 2027, synthetic responses are expected to constitute over half of all market research data, highlighting the urgency for businesses to understand and adopt this technology strategically.

This white paper equips technical business leaders, consumer insights experts, and data scientists with clear and actionable knowledge about this technology.

Key Insights#

Defining Synthetic Consumers: We clearly define synthetic consumers and
distinguish them from related concepts like digital twins, synthetic respondents,
and human simulacra.

Real-World Use Cases: We highlight practical examples of synthetic consumers
applications currently used by both major companies and startups for product
testing, innovation, data augmentation, and consumer insights.

Accuracy and Validation: We analyze methods for evaluating synthetic consumer
accuracy, summarizing recent research that increasingly shows confidence in the
alignment between synthetic and human responses across multiple domains.

PyMC Labs offers unique expertise by creating customized solutions that combine
advanced Generative AI with science-based benchmarking. Our rigorous and
transparent methods allow clients to confidently use synthetic consumer insights for
clear business value.

In this paper, we aim to provide a balanced view on synthetic consumers,
highlighting their transformative potential while recognizing their current limitations.
