PyMC-Marketing vs. Meridian: A Quantitative Comparison of Open Source MMM Libraries

This benchmark study directly compares PyMC-Marketing and Google‚Äôs Meridian on realistic synthetic datasets, from startup-scale to enterprise-level. Using aligned priors and identical configurations, it shows that PyMC-Marketing is consistently faster (2‚Äì20x), more accurate (lower error in channel contribution recovery, higher R¬≤, lower MAPE), and more scalable, thanks to its flexible sampling backends. Meridian remains leaner in storage size but suffers from slower performance, wider uncertainty, and convergence issues at scale. Overall, PyMC-Marketing emerges as the more robust, production-ready MMM library for data science teams.

Announcing the Expert Access Program (EAP)

Teams face critical deadlines where models must be rigorous, but hiring consultants or adding headcount only solves problems temporarily. This is why we created the Expert Access Program ‚Äî to give teams ongoing access to our experts, ensuring their models keep delivering value long after the initial build.

Can LLMs play The Price is Right?

Synthetic consumers‚ÄîLLMs simulating human survey participants‚Äîare becoming a powerful tool for marketing and behavioral research. They promise faster iteration, lower costs, and broader flexibility than traditional panels. But for them to be useful, they need not only to sound realistic, but also to demonstrate some level of real-world reasoning. A core question in this space: do LLMs ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù prices?* That is, can they recognize how much everyday items cost, and make decisions based on that understanding?
