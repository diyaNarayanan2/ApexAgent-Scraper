Bayesian Marketing Mix Models: State of the Art and their Future

November 11, 2022

By Thomas Wiecki

Introduction#

This event is a discussion between Luca Fiaschi and Thomas Wiecki about Bayesian modeling in online marketing with a special focus on Marketing Mix Models and Customer Lifetime Value models.

In the panel discussion, Luca Fiaschi shares his thoughts on the current state and the future of Bayesian data science in online marketing, based on many years of real-world experience leading teams at HelloFresh and Stitchfix. A special focus will be placed on Marketing Mix Models (MMM) and the work PyMC Labs has done with Luca during his time at HelloFresh. In addition, Customer Lifetime Value models play an ever more important role in marketing but remain stuck in old modeling approaches. We will discuss a potential way forward.
