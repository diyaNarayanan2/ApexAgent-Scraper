Latent Calendar: Modeling Weekly Behavior with Latent Components

October 27, 2023

By William Dean

Introduction#

In this webinar, we will explore the use of a traditional Natural Language Processing technique for modeling weekly calendar data. We will delve into how Latent Dirichlet Allocation can be applied to discretized calendar events, allowing us to tap into the model's probabilistic origins and its connection to Bayesian principles, offering a wide array of potential applications and insights.
