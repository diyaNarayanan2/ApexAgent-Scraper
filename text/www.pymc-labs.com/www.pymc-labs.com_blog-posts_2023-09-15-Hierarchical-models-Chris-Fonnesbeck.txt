Developing Hierarchical Models for Sports Analytics

September 26, 2023

By Chris Fonnesbeck

Introduction#

Decision-making in sports has become increasingly data-driven with GPS, cameras, and other sensors providing streams of information at high spatial and temporal resolution. While machine learning is a popular approach for turning these data streams into actionable information, Bayesian statistical methods offer a robust alternative. They allow for the combining of multiple data sources, a natural means for imputing missing data, as well as full accounting for various system uncertainties. In particular, hierarchical models provide a means for integrating information at multiple scales and adjusting for biases associated with small sample sizes. I will demonstrate a Bayesian workflow for model development using PyMC version 5, from data preparation through to the summarization of estimates and predictions, using baseball data.
