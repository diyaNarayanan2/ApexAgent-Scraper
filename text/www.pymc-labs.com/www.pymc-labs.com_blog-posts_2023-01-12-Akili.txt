Likelihood Approximations for Cognitive Modeling with PyMC

January 12, 2023

By Thomas Wiecki

Introduction#

Digital therapeutics are evidence-based, clinically evaluated software and devices that can be used to treat an array of diseases and disorders, according to the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, the industry's trade association. They can be used independently or with medications, devices, and other therapies to treat physical and behavioral health conditions, including pain, diabetes, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and asthma.

In this talk, PyMC Labs and Akili discuss using Bayesian methods and PyMC to test a range of computational models of cognition, specifically with an eye towards ADHD (Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). They focus on some technical challenges and how ideas from likelihood-free inference and machine learning can help overcome them.
